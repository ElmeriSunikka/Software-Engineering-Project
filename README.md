# Software-Engineering-Project

## Project course Autumn of 2021
 
I worked at a Low Code project for Solita.
We created a recruitment game in the low code environment Outsystems.
This project was my first "real" bigger project and taught me a lot about especially how projects are ran, the management of project, how to work as a team in computer science projects
and moreover, it taught me to use low code, that I had previously no experience at all with :)
